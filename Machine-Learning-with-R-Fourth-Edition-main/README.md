# Machine-Learning-with-R-Fourth-Edition
This is the code repository for [Machine Learning with R, Fourth Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-r-fourth-edition/9781801071321), published by Packt.
**Learn techniques for building and improving machine learning models, from data preparation to model tuning, evaluation, and working with big data**

## About the book

With the expert help of Brett Lantz, you’ll learn how to uncover key insights and make new predictions using this hands-on, practical guide to machine learning with R. This 10th Anniversary Edition features an overview of R and plenty of new use cases for advanced users. The book is fully updated to R 4.0.0, with newer and better examples and the most up-to-date R libraries, advice on ethical and bias issues, and new chapters that dive deeper into advanced modeling techniques and methods for using big data in R.

## What you will learn
- Learn the end-to-end process of machine learning from raw data to implementation
- Classify important outcomes using nearest neighbor and Bayesian methods
- Predict future events using decision trees, rules, and support vector machines
- Forecast numeric data and estimate financial values using regression methods
- Model complex processes with artificial neural networks
- Prepare, transform, and clean data using the tidyverse
- Evaluate your models and improve their performance
- Connect R to SQL databases and emerging big data technologies such as Spark, Hadoop, H2O, and TensorFlow

## Get to know the Author
_Brett Lantz_ (DataSpelunking) has spent more than 10 years using innovative data methods to understand human behavior. A sociologist by training, Brett was first captivated by machine learning during research on a large database of teenagers' social network profiles. Brett is a DataCamp instructor and a frequent speaker at machine learning conferences and workshops around the world. He is known to geek out about data science applications for sports, autonomous vehicles, foreign language learning, and fashion, among many other subjects, and hopes to one day blog about these subjects at Data Spelunking, a website dedicated to sharing knowledge about the search for insight in data.
